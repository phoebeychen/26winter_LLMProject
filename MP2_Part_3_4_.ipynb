    "# Mini Project Part-3: Building a Multi-Agent Chatbot (50 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to build a chatbot that utilizes multiple agents, each with a specific role, and a controller agent that manages these sub-agents. The chatbot should be able to handle user queries, check for obnoxious content, and retrieve relevant documents to assist in generating responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Action Items\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup the Environment**: Install necessary libraries such as `openai`, `pinecone`, and any other libraries you might need. Obtain necessary API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement the Obnoxious Agent**: This agent checks if a user's query is obnoxious. If it is, the agent responds with \"Yes\", otherwise \"No\". Implement this agent using the `Obnoxious_Agent` class as a guide.  \n",
    "  *Restriction on Obnoxious agent: Cannot use Langchain API for this agent.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implement Relelevant Documents Agent**: This agent retrieves relevant documents. Implement this agent using the `Relevant_Documents_Agent` class as a guide. Also responsible for checking if the retrieved documents are relevant to the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Restriction on Relevant agent: Cannot use Langchain API for this agent.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement the Pinecone Query Agent**: This agent checks if a user's query is relevant to a specific topic (e.g., a book on Machine Learning) and retrieves relevant documents. Implement this agent using the `Query_Agent` class as a guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Implement the Answering Agent**: This agent generates a response to the user's query using the relevant documents retrieved by the Pinecone Query Agent. Implement this agent using the `Answering_Agent` class as a guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Implement the Head Agent**: This is the controller agent that manages the other agents. It determines which agent to use for each query and uses that agent to get a response. Implement this agent using the `Head_Agent` class as a guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Streamlit App**: Integrate this chatbot into the Streamlit app from Mini-project part-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python code files for each agent and the controller agent.\n",
    "2. A PDF report that contains a design diagram of your approach along with some screenshots of Streamlit demoing 3-4 test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "1. Completion: Are all components implemented in a reasonable way? (25 points)\n",
    "2. Documentation: Is the process well-documented, with a diagram and descriptions of challenges and solutions? (20 points)\n",
    "3. Creativity: How creatively has the problem been solved? (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes:\n",
    "- There are no specific constraints on the implementation methods for the agents. However, it is crucial that the agents can interact with each other and the controller agent effectively.\n",
    "- You have the liberty to modify the provided agent classes to fit your implementation strategy.\n",
    "- You can utilize any libraries or APIs to construct the chatbot. However, the use of the Langchain API is prohibited for the Obnoxious and Relevant Documents agents. The Langchain API can be used for the Pinecone Query and Answering agents.\n",
    "- Please use `gpt-4.1-nano` for all agents. \n",
    "- Below we provide some starter code, but feel free to modify it if you have an alternate design in mind\n",

    "# Mini Project Part-4: Evaluating a Multi-Agent Chatbot (50 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "This part focuses on the \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" paradigm, where you will design a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate your multi-agent system's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Action Items\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Develop the Test Dataset\n",
    "Create a dataset of **50 prompt/response pairs** to test your bot. While you can curate these manually, you are encouraged to use a synthetic generation strategy (e.g., prompting GPT-4 to generate diverse test cases). The dataset must include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Basic Test Cases:**\n",
    "    * **Obnoxious Queries:** 10 prompts designed to trigger the `Obnoxious_Agent` where we want refusal (e.g., \"Explain machine learning, idiot\").\n",
    "    * **Irrelevant Queries:** 10 prompts completely unrelated to your indexed Pinecone data where we want refusal (e.g., \"Who won the super bowl in 2026?\").\n",
    "    * **Relevant Queries:** 10 prompts directly addressed by your indexed documents where we do not want a refusal (e.g., \"Explain logistic regression.\").\n",
    "    * **Greetings/Small Talk:** 5 prompts where we do not want a refusal (e.g., \"Hello\", \"Good morning\").\n",
    "* **Advanced Test Cases:**\n",
    "    * **Hybrid Prompts:** 8 prompts containing a mixture of relevant and irrelevant/obnoxious content (e.g., \"Tell me about Machine Learning and then tell me the capital of France.\"). The bot must isolate and respond **only** to the relevant part.\n",
    "    * **Multi-turn Conversations:** 7 scenarios involving 2-3 turns each, specifically testing context retention of **previous relevant user inputs and bot outputs**. For example, if a user says something obnoxious but then later asks a relevant question, the agent should still respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Implement the \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" Agent\n",
    "Create a new evaluation script or agent that acts as a judge. This agent will take the `User Input`, the `Chatbot Response`, and the `Chatbot Agent Path` (which agent generated the final answer) to score the performance. For now, we just want to make sure that the agent behaves correctly and we do not need to evaluate whether or not the models final response is factually correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Judge Capability: Binary Classification:** \n",
    "    * The judge must accurately classify if the chatbot **Responded** (generated an answer) or **Refused** (blocked for safety/relevancy). It should produce a score of **1** when the chatbot exhibits the desired response and **0** otherwise.\n",
    "    * For hybrid prompts, a score of **1** should be produced only when the model refuses or ignores the irrelevant component and answers the relevent component. If either of these criteria is violated, produce a score of **0**.\n",
    "    * For multi-turn conversations, you should only evaluate the last response. For example, if the history contains the following: 1 query/response about logistic regression  and the follow up question is the following: \"Tell me more about it\", the response should not \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Compute Aggregated Metrics\n",
    "Run your test prompts through the chatbot, collect the response from the judge, and compute the overall performance by summing up the individual scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1.  The Python scripts containing the test dataset generation/loading logic, the LLM Judge prompt engineering, and the execution loop.\n",
    "2. **`test_set.json`**: A JSON file that contains the actual test prompts that you used.\n",
    "3. Documentation that briefly describes your data generation approach, and reports the final metric. You should describe some weaknesses of your agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "1. Completness: Does the test set contain all the types of prompts? (25 points)\n",
    "2. Soundness: Do the provided prompts make sense? Are they realistic? Are they diverse? (10 points)\n",
    "3. Documentation: Is the process well documented with descriptions on how the data was generated, failure modes of the agent, and the final performance? (15 points) \n"
